# Eclipse GLSP - Minimal Example
This example shows the integration of a very basic GLSP Diagram Editor into a Theia browser application. This demonstrates the core concepts and basic client-server integration into Theia.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries/frameworks need to be installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 12.14.1 AND < 13`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable) `>=1.7.0`
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) `>=11`
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `>=3.6.0`

 The examples are heavily interweaved with Eclipse Theia, so please also check the [prerequisites of Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/Developing.md#prerequisites).

The web-based/client part of the examples has been developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the server/java part has been developed with the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/). However, it's of course also possible to use any other IDE or text editor.

## Building the example
The server component of the minimal example has to be built using Maven, the client component has to be built using yarn. This can be done via CLI:

    cd server/org.eclipse.glsp.example.minimal && mvn clean install && cd ../..
    cd client && yarn && cd ..

## Running the  example
To start the Theia web app with the integrated minimal example simply navigate to
the client directory :

    cd client 

and then execute:

    yarn start:browser

This will launch the example in the browser on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).<br>
